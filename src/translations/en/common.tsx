/*
PLURALITY:
	Some terms will end in _one or _other. They always have a `count` property that can be used if needed.
		dog_one = 1 dog
		dog_other = 0 dogs, 2+ dogs, etc
	Other languages may have their own plurality _endings. Check your i18n specifications.

CONTEXTS:
	Some terms may be used in a specific context.

	dog = Normal use, e.g. "dog"
	dog_filename = Must consist of only characters safe to use in a filename.
		(this is generally anything except \/:*?"<>|), e.g. "dog"
	dog_formal = This is being used as a proper name or otherwise has
		importance. In English, this simply means Capitalizing Most Words,
		e.g. "Dog"
	dog_presentation = This is a user-facing term that is
		"pointing" at...
			* important information
			* a text box
			* a selectable option
			* a toggleable option
			* etc.
		In English, I add a colon on the end of the formal term, e.g. "Dog:"

LEGEND:
	游린 Headers (important text in the app, possibly placed in the toolbar)
	游댮 button or option text
	游리 dialog box messages (yes/no prompts, alerts, etc)
	游릳 dialog box headers
	[T:x] toast messages (popups that disappear on their own in `x` seconds)
	游댯 ARIA labels (accessibility messages, not visible to the average user)

	Keys without any of these notes are only shown on-screen in plain text.

	Button text should be kept short. Dialog box text should be clear and concise.
	Text headers should be relatively short and are usually capitalized. Dialog
	box headers should be kept reasonably short. Users should be able to read toast
	messages before `x` seconds have expired.
