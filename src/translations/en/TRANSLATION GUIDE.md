# Translation Guide

## PLURALITY

Some terms will end in \_one or \_other. They always have a `count` property that can be used if needed.

>**dog_one** = 1 dog
>
>>`"There is {{count}} dog."`  
>>= "There is 1 dog."
>
>**dog_other** = 0 dogs, 2+ dogs, etc
>
>>`"There are {{count}} dogs."`  
>>= "There are 17 dogs."

Other languages may have their own plurality \_endings. Check your i18n specifications.
